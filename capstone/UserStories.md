# Current User Stories

1. As a researcher, I would like to input R8 selection rules so I can see the varying effects in the simulation.

2. As a user, I would like to be able to pause the simulation so I can evaluate different instances with great detail.

3. As a customer/developer, I would like the simulation to be written in Python v3.0 so I can maintain this code.

4. As a researcher, I would like to view statistics about the simulation so I can measure the varying effects between simulations.

5. As a collaborator, I would like to share configurations so multiple people can see the same simulation run.
