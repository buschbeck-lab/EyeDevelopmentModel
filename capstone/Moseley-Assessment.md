# Senior Design Capstone Assessment by Nick Moseley

Our project is to create a simulation for the biology department at the University of Cincinnati. This simulation will focus on Drosophilia Eye Development. A theory exists
that much can be learned about many other species’ eye development from drosophilia (fruit flies.) Our goal is to provide a visual means to explore this hypothesis. We would also
like to provide not just a visual representation of the eye development, but a statistical report with each run though of the simulation. This will provide additional metrics which
elaborate based on both the starting parameters and the outcome of the simulation.

My experience thus far will contribute greatly toward this project. From the computer science curriculum, software engineering is a major contributor. As the class was
largely group based, I have learned to communicate in a structured manner using tools and diagrams learned directly from that class. This class has also helped me in communicating
with the customer from a requirements engineering perspective. Both the data structures course and programming languages course contribute by helping me develop programming skills
necessary to implement our project. Technical writing has helped me formalize and preserve these thoughts through reports which will be necessary for our customer.

Individual coop experience includes a heavy research focus which is perfect for this project. As this simulation has never been done before, research both about the specifics
of the biological process and the tools we’ll use for the visual aspects of the simulation will be needed. My research experience has promoted my confidence in being able to
contribute to these tasks. The lab work I have completed was also primarily done in Python which is a base requirement for the simulation. This includes everything from ideas to
development and testing the code base. Finally, providing regular feedback through reports was a major part of my experience at the World Bank which will also be useful.

Our approach includes a few frequent meetings with our customer to begin. These meetings are assisted by a heavy research effort in both the tools we will use for development
and research in the area. To build a great simulation requires both technical knowledge about how to implement the project, as well as background in the area that the simulation is
based. The meetings and research is necessary to make sure we have a solid understanding of the biology we are simulating and to narrow down the requirements for the intended purpose
of this simulation. As we start to implement some of the basic class structures and interact with them, we are predicting new problems and a lack of understanding will arise. In
setting frequent meetings, we are hoping to identify and address these as soon as possible.

Our metric for success relies heavily on the satisfaction of our customer. We have defined a clear goal which is to develop a 2-D simulation based on a preset list of variables.
Anything past this will be nothing but improvements. Both our teams’ skill level and commitment as well as our philosophy about the importance of our starting approach makes it
impossible to fail. Our goal is to under-promise, but over-deliver. This will help manage expectations as well as provide the initiative to complete the best possible.
