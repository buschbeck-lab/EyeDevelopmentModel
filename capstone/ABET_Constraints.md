## Professional

The project is set up as a volunteer effort for the Neurology department in the University of Cincinnati. We are designing this product as free-to-use for everyone interested. While the system design and implementation is our team’s responsibility, the success metric is largely dependent upon the rules governing the biology of the process we are simulating. Our team has little to no background in this area. Hence, the success of the product depends heavily on the communication between the expertise of our customer and the strategy for implementing our simulation based on the goals the customer has set. Because of this, our professional reputation could be affected directly by both the requirements portion and the implementation of this project as the resulting application is a clear advertisement of our ability.

## Economic


Before beginning a project, it is good to plan out the expected expenses which are expected to be accrued.  Luckily for us, we don’t have the normal expenses such as freeware, travel, and otherwise.  All billable time put into this project is donated.  Much of this is due to the nature of software development and the flexibility which it allows.  Since each of us have a laptop to work on, we are able to work nearly anywhere we’d like, whenever we’d like.  The resulting product will be used mainly for academic purposes, so any economic return will be received by the user of our software.

## Social


Our project will be used by neurobiology researchers at UC (and possibly other universities). If it leads to interesting research, that will have benefitted society in the abstract sense that knowledge is usually good. Even if our project fails, because nothing like it exists, it may inspire others to create a better version, and that would abstractly better society. It will probably never directly enhance anyone’s quality of life, although it could help produce research that eventually indirectly enhances someone’s quality of life, perhaps if the research has applications to medicine. Certainly the project will not harm anyone or decrease anyone’s quality of life. There are no users who could be negatively impacted, and no privacy concerns.


## Legal


There are minimal legal constraints associated with this project. These constraints all revolve around licensing. Our project is meant to be used in published research and to be modified extensively by research teams both at UC and throughout the rest of the world. Because of this requirement we must restrict ourselves to only use external libraries with permissive licenses. Licenses that don't allow redistribution of the source code cannot be used, and copyleft licenses are to be avoided. Our project itself will use the most open license available that still conforms to the needs of the UC neurobiology team.
