# Current User Stories

1. As a researcher, I would like to input R8 selection rules so I can see the varying effects in the simulation.

2. As a user, I would like to be able to pause the simulation so I can evaluate different instances with great detail.

3. As a customer/developer, I would like the simulation to be written in Python v3.0 so I can maintain this code.

4. As a researcher, I would like to view statistics about the simulation so I can measure the varying effects between simulations.

5. As a collaborator, I would like to share configurations so multiple people can see the same simulation run.

6. As a user, I want to input R8 selection rules so that I can see the varying effects in the simulation.

7. As a user, I want to be able to pause the simulation so that I can evaluate different instances with great detail.

8. As a customer/developer, I want the simulation to be written in Python v3 so that I can maintain this code.

9. As a researcher, I want to view statistics about the simulation so that I can quantitatively measure the varying effects of different inputs.

10. As a user, I want to share configurations so that multiple people can see the same simulation run.

11. As a user, I want to change rules surrounding cell death so that I can study the varying effects in the simulation.

12. As a user, I want to change the width of the furrow so that I can study the varying effects in the simulation.

13. As a user, I want to watch the simulation of the specialization process so that I can observe the impact of different inputs on the simulation.

14. As a user, I want to modify the specialization process of the furrow so that I can observe the results of different specialization processes.

15. As a user, I want to modify the parameters of custom specializations processes of the furrow so that I can easily test variations of the same specialization process.

16. As a user, I want to modify the speed of the visualization of the simulation so that I can watch different parts of the specialization process in varying detail.

17. As a user, I want to replay a visualization of the simulation so that I can gain a better understanding of the changes caused by a particular input.

18. As a user, I want to save a simulation so that I can replay the simulation later.

19. As a user, I want to save an input configuration so that I can run a different simulation with the same input parameters.

20. As a user, I want to load an existing configuration so that I can run configurations that I have saved.

21. As a user, I want to save an epithelium so that the same epithelium can be used repeatedly.

22. As a user, I want to generate different types of epithelium so that I can test the process on different epithelium.
