##Project Background Description
The underlying biological processes and patterns of early eye development are known for fruit flies and a few other species; however, a comprehensive model for all species has not been built. This project aims to use known rules to predict the development of any species’ eyes by applying said rules to variable biological constraints. The simulated structure can then be compared to real samples to determine if this model can be used to correctly predict eye development in other species.

##Problem Statement
Simulating the development of eyes by projecting known growth models onto variable biological constraints.

##Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Existing simulations either do not adequately simulate the macro level growth of the eye, or do not adequately use what is known about current models to predict the growth of different eye types.
