    """
    Cells exert pushing and pulling forces on each other. The job
    of the CellCollisionHandler is to efficiently move cells based on
    these forces.

    A given cell only exerts forces on its surrounding neighbors.
    So, if we have a sheet of a thousand cells, every cell affects
    at most a dozen others at one point in time, probably. So,
    a naive quadratic algorithm algorithm that computes forces
    for all pairs of cells will be inefficient, because most cells
    don't affect one another. But, cells move, and the cells that
    another impacts changes over time. If we determine up front
    all the cells that are relevant to a given cell, and efficiently
    maintain this over time, then we can get linear performance.
    For each cell, there's only a constant number of other cells relevant
    to it that we need to consider when computing forces.

    We partition R^2 into a grid of boxes, where each box is a little
    bigger than the average cell diameter, and define a mapping from
    cell positions to the corresponding box. Then, to get the neighbors
    of a cell, we get the coordinates of its box in the grid and do
    simple arithmetic to find its neighboring boxes, and get the cells
    in those boxes. If a cell is in box (i,j) for example, its neighbors
    would be in boxes like (i-1, j-1) (top left), (i, j-1) (left),
    ..., (i+1, j+1) (bottom right).
    The mapping from cell position to grid coordinate takes constant time,
    and is recomputed every time a cell's position changes.
    Decompacting the list of cells is linear w.r.t. the number of cells.

    This grid structure also allows us to get the list of cells within
    a certain distance of another cell in time proportional to the distance.

    :param cells: the list of cells to track.
    :param force_escape: determines distance at which pulling forces are exerted.
       If escape=1, then cells don't exert any pulling forces. If >1,
       cells exert pulling forces until their distance is greater than
       escape multiplied by the sum of their radii (two cells
       touching have a distance equal to the sum of their radii).
       A small escape, like around 1.05, will mean that cells tend to stick
       togther and overlap maybe a little bit. A large escape tends to make
       cells overlap a lot (since cells would exert non-local pulling forces)
    :param allow_overlap: If less than 1, cells exert pulling forces on
       each other when colliding, making them overlap in equilibrium.
    :param spring_constant: determines spring stiffness; linearly correlated
       to the magnitude of the force cells exert on each other.
